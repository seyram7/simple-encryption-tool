# 🔐 Simple Encryption & Decryption Tool (Python CLI)

This is a lightweight Python-based tool that allows you to securely encrypt and decrypt text messages using symmetric key encryption. It uses the Fernet module from Python's powerful `cryptography` library to ensure confidentiality and ease of use.

---

## 📦 Features

- ✅ Generate and save secret encryption keys
- ✅ Load existing encryption keys
- ✅ Encrypt any plain text message
- ✅ Decrypt encrypted messages
- ✅ Simple command-line interface for ease of use

---

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **Language:** Python 3
- **Library:** [`cryptography`](https://cryptography.io/en/latest/)

## 🚀 How to Use

### 1. Install Required Library

Make sure you have Python installed. Then run:

```bash
pip install cryptography
````

---

### 2. Run the Tool

```bash
python encrypt_decrypt_tool.py
```

---

### 3. Menu Options

When you launch the tool, you'll see a menu like this:

```
[1] Generate Key
[2] Load Existing Key
[3] Encrypt a Message
[4] Decrypt a Message
[5] Exit
```

#### 🔑 Generate Key

Creates a secure symmetric encryption key and saves it as `secret.key`.

#### 📥 Load Existing Key

Loads your previously saved `secret.key` file to be used for encryption/decryption.

#### 🔐 Encrypt Message

Input a plain text message. The tool will return a securely encrypted version.

#### 🔓 Decrypt Message

Input a valid encrypted message. The tool will return the original plain text (if the correct key is loaded).

## 🔐 Security Note

This tool uses **Fernet**, which guarantees that a message encrypted cannot be manipulated or read without the key. However, this is still a basic educational tool and not production-grade security software. Use responsibly.
